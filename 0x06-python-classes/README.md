# Python - Classes and Objects

## Introduction to new concept (OOP)
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A **class** creates a new type where **objects** are **instances** of the class.

In this project we tackle the following concepts;
* Class: A blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
* Object: An instance of a class that represents a real-world entity.
* Attributes: Data members or variables that store the state of an object.
* Methods: Functions that define the behavior of objects.
* Encapsulation: The bundling of data and methods within a class, controlling access through visibility modifiers.
* Inheritance: The ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from its parent class.
* Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

*This project is part of the ALX software engineering program 2023.*
